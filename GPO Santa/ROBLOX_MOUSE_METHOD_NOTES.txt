ROBLOX FIRST-PERSON CAMERA MOUSE CONTROL - TEST RESULTS
====================================================================
Date: December 29, 2025
Test File: test_first_person_camera.py
Application: GPO Santa V2.py

====================================================================
WORKING METHODS (Tested with 500px movement):
====================================================================

✓ METHOD 4: win32api mouse_event
   - Code: win32api.mouse_event(win32con.MOUSEEVENTF_MOVE, 500, 0, 0, 0)
   - Import: import win32api, win32con
   - Type: Relative movement
   - Performance: WORKS

✓ METHOD 6: ctypes SendInput
   - Code: ctypes.windll.user32.SendInput(1, ctypes.byref(ii_), ctypes.sizeof(ii_))
   - Import: import ctypes, from ctypes import wintypes
   - Type: Relative movement via MOUSEINPUT structure
   - Performance: WORKS
   - Note: More complex to implement but offers fine control

✓ METHOD 7: pydirectinput moveRel
   - Code: pydirectinput.moveRel(500, 0, relative=True)
   - Import: import pydirectinput
   - Type: Relative movement
   - Performance: WORKS
   - Note: Specifically designed for games

✓ METHOD 8: pydirectinput with zero pause
   - Code: pydirectinput.PAUSE = 0; pydirectinput.moveRel(500, 0, relative=True)
   - Import: import pydirectinput
   - Type: Relative movement with no delay
   - Performance: WORKS
   - Note: Faster execution than Method 7

====================================================================
FAILED METHODS:
====================================================================

✗ METHOD 1-3: PyAutoGUI variants - Did not work with Roblox
✗ METHOD 5: win32api SetCursorPos (Absolute) - Did not work with Roblox
✗ METHOD 9: mouse library - Did not work with Roblox
✗ METHOD 10: ctypes SetCursorPos - Did not work with Roblox
✗ METHOD 11: win32api smooth movement loop - Did not work with Roblox
✗ METHOD 12: PyAutoGUI with tweening - Did not work with Roblox

====================================================================
CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION IN GPO SANTA V2.py:
====================================================================

Line 1026: ctypes.windll.user32.SetCursorPos(target_x, target_y)
           - Absolute positioning (for initial cursor placement)
           
Line 1028: ctypes.windll.user32.mouse_event(0x0001, 0, 1, 0, 0)
           - Relative movement of 1px down
           - This is a workaround to register the movement with Roblox

====================================================================
RECOMMENDATION FOR FUTURE IMPLEMENTATION:
====================================================================

BEST METHOD: Method 7 or 8 - pydirectinput.moveRel()
- Already imported in GPO Santa V2.py (line 13)
- Specifically designed for game compatibility
- Simple, clean API
- Method 8 (with PAUSE=0) offers fastest execution

ALTERNATIVE: Method 4 - win32api.mouse_event()
- Native Windows API
- No additional dependencies
- Similar to current implementation

BACKUP: Method 6 - ctypes SendInput
- Most low-level control
- More complex but most reliable for anti-cheat systems

====================================================================
IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
====================================================================

For first-person camera control in Roblox:
1. Use RELATIVE mouse movement, not absolute positioning
2. Small, frequent movements work better than large jumps
3. pydirectinput is already imported and available
4. Current method (SetCursorPos + mouse_event workaround) works but could be simplified

SUGGESTED CODE REPLACEMENT:
Instead of:
    ctypes.windll.user32.SetCursorPos(target_x, target_y)
    ctypes.windll.user32.mouse_event(0x0001, 0, 1, 0, 0)

Use:
    # Calculate delta from current position
    current_x, current_y = win32api.GetCursorPos()
    dx = target_x - current_x
    dy = target_y - current_y
    # Use pydirectinput for relative movement
    pydirectinput.moveRel(dx, dy, relative=True)

OR for finer control:
    win32api.mouse_event(win32con.MOUSEEVENTF_MOVE, dx, dy, 0, 0)
