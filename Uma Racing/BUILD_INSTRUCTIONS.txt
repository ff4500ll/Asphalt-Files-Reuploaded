# Build Instructions for UmaRacing.exe

## Prerequisites
Install PyInstaller if you haven't already:
```
pip install pyinstaller
```

## Build Commands

### For p.py (original version):
```
pyinstaller p.spec
```
Output: `dist\UmaRacing.exe`

### For z.py (new version with queue system):
```
pyinstaller z.spec
```
Output: `dist\UmaRacingZ.exe`

## Notes
- The PNG files (E.png, F.png, Q.png, R.png) are bundled inside the .exe
- Settings files are saved in the same directory as the .exe:
  - p.py uses `p_settings.json`
  - z.py uses `UmaRacingSettings.json`
- All paths are automatically handled for both .py and .exe execution
- Console window is hidden (`console=False` in spec files)

## Testing
After building, copy the .exe to a new folder and run it to verify everything works.
