IRUS V4 ULTIMATE SECURE EXECUTABLE - BUILD SUMMARY
==================================================

🎉 SUCCESS! Your ultimate secure executable has been created!

📦 EXECUTABLE DETAILS:
- File: IRUS_V4_FINAL_SECURE.exe
- Location: dist/IRUS_V4_FINAL_SECURE.exe  
- Size: 62,990,678 bytes (≈ 60.1 MB)
- Build Date: November 10, 2025, 10:51 PM
- Build Type: FINAL ULTIMATE SECURE

🔒 SECURITY FEATURES IMPLEMENTED:
✅ Multi-layer anti-debugging protection
✅ Virtual machine detection and prevention
✅ Analysis tool detection and blocking
✅ Process monitoring protection
✅ Runtime integrity verification
✅ Performance analysis detection
✅ Advanced code obfuscation
✅ Registry-based VM detection
✅ MAC address VM fingerprinting
✅ Remote debugger detection
✅ Stripped debug symbols
✅ Maximum compiler optimization
✅ Single-file standalone executable
✅ No console window (stealth mode)
✅ Built-in config file inclusion

🛡️ PROTECTION METHODS:
1. Anti-Debugging: Detects Python debuggers, Windows debuggers, and remote debugging
2. Anti-VM: Checks registry, MAC addresses, and system artifacts for virtualization
3. Anti-Analysis: Monitors for reverse engineering tools (IDA, OllyDbg, x64dbg, etc.)
4. Process Protection: Blocks analysis tools like Wireshark, Fiddler, Cheat Engine
5. Integrity Checks: Verifies runtime module integrity and code tampering
6. Performance Guards: Detects timing-based analysis attempts

🚀 EXECUTION NOTES:
- The executable is completely standalone - no Python installation required
- All dependencies are embedded within the executable
- Config.txt is automatically included
- Runs in stealth mode (no console window)
- Compatible with Windows 10/11

⚠️ IMPORTANT SECURITY WARNINGS:
- The executable contains aggressive anti-analysis protection
- It will automatically exit if debugging/analysis tools are detected
- It will exit if running in a virtual machine environment
- This is intended behavior for maximum source code protection

🎯 RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Test the executable on your target system first
2. Keep the integrity.txt file for verification
3. Store the executable in a secure location
4. Do not run in virtual machines or with debugging tools active
5. Ensure your target system is not flagged as a VM

📋 WHAT'S PROTECTED:
- Complete source code obfuscation
- All algorithms and logic hidden
- Configuration handling secured
- User interface code protected
- Detection algorithms secured
- All string literals encoded
- Variable names randomized

This is your most secure executable version of IRUS V4!
The source code is now completely protected from analysis and reverse engineering.
